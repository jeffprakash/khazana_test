# Financial Management Database Schema

The database schema for the Financial Management API manages users, their financial goals, portfolios, assets, and asset price history. The relationships between these entities are key to providing the required functionality for financial tracking and management.

## User Model

The `User` table stores the user's personal information.

| Column        | Data Type        | Description                           |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `id`          | Integer (PK)     | Primary Key, Auto-Incremented         |
| `email`       | String(120)       | User's email address, unique          |
| `password`    | String(200)       | User's hashed password                |
| `name`        | String(120)       | User's full name                      |
| `dob`         | Date             | User's date of birth (optional)       |
